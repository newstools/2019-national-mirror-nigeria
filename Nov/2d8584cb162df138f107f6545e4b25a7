A Nigerian weightlifter stripped of a Commonwealth Games gold medal for doping when she was 16 years old has tested positive again and faces an eight-year ban from the sport. The report said Chika Amalaha, whose sample showed traces of steroids, is the third Nigerian woman to have twice tested positive in recent years â€“ all of the continental champions. The past seven Nigerian doping violations announced by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) are all female, and there are two cases yet to be closed, also women.
