The new Lagos Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, is planning to relocate the Lagos annual trade fair soon. Although no concrete details were shared by the governor on moving the annual trade event, Sanwo-Olu said on Monday hinted on the relocation plan. Sanwo-Olu said the move would assuage the operational challenges faced by the organisers of the fair annually and make it at par with other international exhibitions across the globe. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governor spoke after visiting some pavilions at the ongoing 2019 Lagos International Trade Fair, taking place at the Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS), Lagos. Over two thousand foreign and local exhibitors are participating in the 33rd Edition of the fair which has the theme: “Connecting Businesses, Creating Value.” The governor, who was led on the tour by Mr Babatunde Ruwase, President, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that the fair was an avenue for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to showcase their products to the world.
